There were quite a few things in this workshop which i remembered in the last semester the concept we learned in cpp was of namespaces and 
the first problem i faced in this workshop was of namespaces. I forgot to put the namespace seneca and used namespace sdds which we used 
for the entirity of the last semester. Then I also used the alocopy function from the utils of last Semesters project. The new concept 
introduced was of passing arguments to main which was very easy and the topic of extern gave me some trouble but reading about it again 
was enought to solve the errors releated to it. In the end i also got a memory leak which was because of the alocopy function not deleting 
the allocated memory to the destination but i was able to figure it out pretty quickly. Overall, this workshop was easy and professor told
to use one topic from the last semester which i think is the rule of three that's why i have commented it in such a way.:)
